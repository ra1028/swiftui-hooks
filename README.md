## Introduction

```swift
func timer() -> some View {
    let time = useState(Date())

    useEffect(.once) {
        let timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1, repeats: true) {
            time.wrappedValue = $0.fireDate
        }

        return {
            timer.invalidate()
        }
    }

    return Text("Time: \(time.wrappedValue)")
}
```

SwiftUI Hooks is a SwiftUI implementation of React Hooks. Brings the state and lifecycle into the function view, without depending on elements that are only allowed to be used in struct views such as `@State` or `@ObservedObject`.  
It allows you to reuse stateful logic between views by building custom hooks composed with multiple hooks.  
Furthermore, hooks such as `useEffect` also solve the problem of lack of lifecycles in SwiftUI.  

The API and behavioral specs of SwiftUI Hooks are entirely based on React Hooks, so you can leverage your knowledge of web applications to your advantage.  

There're already a bunch of documentations on React Hooks, so you can refer to it and learn more about Hooks.

## Hooks API

ðŸ‘‡ Click to open the description.  

<details>
<summary><CODE>useState</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useState<State>(_ initialState: State) -> Binding<State>
func useState<State>(_ initialState: @escaping () -> State) -> Binding<State>
```

A hook to use a `Binding<State>` wrapping current state to be updated by setting a new state to `wrappedValue`.  
Triggers a view update when the state has been changed.

```swift
let count = useState(0)  // Binding<Int>

Button("Increment") {
    count.wrappedValue += 1
}
```

If the initial state is the result of an expensive computation, you may provide a closure instead.
The closure will be executed once, during the initial render.

```swift
let count = useState {
    let initialState = expensiveComputation() // Int
    return initialState
}                                             // Binding<Int>

Button("Increment") {
    count.wrappedValue += 1
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useEffect</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useEffect(_ updateStrategy: HookUpdateStrategy? = nil, _ effect: @escaping () -> (() -> Void)?)
```

A hook to use a side effect function that is called the number of times according to the strategy specified with `updateStrategy`.  
Optionally the function can be cancelled when this hook is disposed or when the side-effect function is called again.  
Note that the execution is deferred until after other hooks have been updated.  

```swift
useEffect {
    print("Do side effects")

    return {
        print("Do cleanup")
    }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useLayoutEffect</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useLayoutEffect(_ updateStrategy: HookUpdateStrategy? = nil, _ effect: @escaping () -> (() -> Void)?)
```

A hook to use a side effect function that is called the number of times according to the strategy specified with `updateStrategy`.  
Optionally the function can be cancelled when this hook is unmount from the view tree or when the side-effect function is called again.  
The signature is identical to `useEffect`, but this fires synchronously when the hook is called.  

```swift
useLayoutEffect {
    print("Do side effects")
    return nil
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useMemo</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useMemo<Value>(_ updateStrategy: HookUpdateStrategy, _ makeValue: @escaping () -> Value) -> Value
```

A hook to use memoized value preserved until it is updated at the timing determined with given `updateStrategy`.  

```swift
let random = useMemo(.once) {
    Int.random(in: 0...100)
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useRef</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useRef<T>(_ initialValue: T) -> RefObject<T>
```

A hook to use a mutable ref object storing an arbitrary value.  
The essential of this hook is that setting a value to `current` doesn't trigger a view update.  

```swift
let value = useRef("text")  // RefObject<String>

Button("Save text") {
    value.current = "new text"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useReducer</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useReducer<State, Action>(_ reducer: @escaping (State, Action) -> State, initialState: State) -> (state: State, dispatch: (Action) -> Void)
```

A hook to use the state returned by the passed `reducer`, and a `dispatch` function to send actions to update the state.  
Triggers a view update when the state has been changed.  

```swift
enum Action {
    case increment, decrement
}

func reducer(state: Int, action: Action) -> Int {
    switch action {
        case .increment:
            return state + 1

        case .decrement:
            return state - 1
    }
}

let (count, dispatch) = useReducer(reducer, initialState: 0)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useAsync</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useAsync<Output>(_ updateStrategy: HookUpdateStrategy, _ operation: @escaping () async -> Output) -> AsyncPhase<Output, Never>
func useAsync<Output>(_ updateStrategy: HookUpdateStrategy, _ operation: @escaping () async throws -> Output) -> AsyncPhase<Output, Error>
```

A hook to use the most recent phase of asynchronous operation of the passed function.  
The function will be performed at the first update and will be re-performed according to the given `updateStrategy`.  

```swift
let phase = useAsync(.once) {
    try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useAsyncPerform</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useAsyncPerform<Output>(_ operation: @escaping @MainActor () async -> Output) -> (phase: AsyncPhase<Output, Never>, perform: @MainActor () async -> Void)
func useAsyncPerform<Output>(_ operation: @escaping @MainActor () async throws -> Output) -> (phase: AsyncPhase<Output, Error>, perform: @MainActor () async -> Void)
```

A hook to use the most recent phase of the passed asynchronous operation, and a `perform` function to call the it at arbitrary timing.  

```swift
let (phase, perform) = useAsyncPerform {
    try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>usePublisher</CODE></summary>

```swift
func usePublisher<P: Publisher>(_ updateStrategy: HookUpdateStrategy, _ makePublisher: @escaping () -> P) -> AsyncPhase<P.Output, P.Failure>
```

A hook to use the most recent phase of asynchronous operation of the passed publisher.  
The publisher will be subscribed at the first update and will be re-subscribed according to the given `updateStrategy`.  

```swift
let phase = usePublisher(.once) {
    URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>usePublisherSubscribe</CODE></summary>

```swift
func usePublisherSubscribe<P: Publisher>(_ makePublisher: @escaping () -> P) -> (phase: AsyncPhase<P.Output, P.Failure>, subscribe: () -> Void)
```

A hook to use the most recent phase of asynchronous operation of the passed publisher, and a `subscribe` function to subscribe to it at arbitrary timing.  

```swift
let (phase, subscribe) = usePublisherSubscribe {
    URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url)
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useEnvironment</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useEnvironment<Value>(_ keyPath: KeyPath<EnvironmentValues, Value>) -> Value
```

A hook to use environment value passed through the view tree without `@Environment` property wrapper.  

```swift
let colorScheme = useEnvironment(\.colorScheme)  // ColorScheme
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><CODE>useContext</CODE></summary>

```swift
func useContext<T>(_ context: Context<T>.Type) -> T
```

A hook to use current context value that is provided by `Context<T>.Provider`.  
The purpose is identical to use `Context<T>.Consumer`.  
See [Context](#context) section for more details.  

```swift
let value = useContext(Context<Int>.self)  // Int
```

</details>

## Rules of Hooks

In order to take advantage of the wonderful interface of Hooks, the same rules that React hooks has must also be followed by SwiftUI Hooks.  

**[Disclaimer]**: These rules are not technical constraints specific to SwiftUI Hooks, but are necessary based on the design of the Hooks itself. You can see [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) to know more about the rules defined for React Hooks.  

\* In -Onone builds, if a violation against this rules is detected, it asserts by an internal sanity check to help the developer notice the mistake in the use of hooks. However, hooks also has `disableHooksRulesAssertion` modifier in case you want to disable the assertions.  

### Only Call Hooks at the Function Top Level

Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops. The order in which hook is called is important since Hooks uses [LinkedList](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) to keep track of its state.  

ðŸŸ¢ **DO**

```swift
@ViewBuilder
func counterButton() -> some View {
    let count = useState(0)  // ðŸŸ¢ Uses hook at the top level

    Button("You clicked \(count.wrappedValue) times") {
        count.wrappedValue += 1
    }
}
```

ðŸ”´ **DON'T**

```swift
@ViewBuilder
func counterButton() -> some View {
    if condition {
        let count = useState(0)  // ðŸ”´ Uses hook inside condition.

        Button("You clicked \(count.wrappedValue) times") {
            count.wrappedValue += 1
        }
    }
}
```

### Only Call Hooks from `HookScope` or `HookView.hookBody`

In order to preserve the state, hooks must be called inside a `HookScope`.  
A view that conforms to the `HookView` protocol will automatically be enclosed in a `HookScope`.  

ðŸŸ¢ **DO**

```swift
struct CounterButton: HookView {  // ðŸŸ¢ `HookView` is used.
    var hookBody: some View {
        let count = useState(0)

        Button("You clicked \(count.wrappedValue) times") {
            count.wrappedValue += 1
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
func counterButton() -> some View {
    HookScope {  // ðŸŸ¢ `HookScope` is used.
        let count = useState(0)

        Button("You clicked \(count.wrappedValue) times") {
            count.wrappedValue += 1
        }
    }
}
```

```swift
struct ContentView: HookView {
    var hookBody: some View {
        counterButton()
    }

    // ðŸŸ¢ Called from `HookView.hookBody` or `HookScope`.
    @ViewBuilder
    var counterButton: some View {
        let count = useState(0)

        Button("You clicked \(count.wrappedValue) times") {
            count.wrappedValue += 1
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ”´ **DON'T**

```swift
// ðŸ”´ Neither `HookScope` nor `HookView` is used, and is not called from them.
@ViewBuilder
func counterButton() -> some View {
    let count = useState(0)

    Button("You clicked \(count.wrappedValue) times") {
        count.wrappedValue += 1
    }
}
```

## Building Your Own Hooks

Building your own hooks lets you extract stateful logic into reusable functions.  
Hooks are composable since they serve as a stateful functions. So, they can be able to compose with other hooks to create your own custom hook.  

In the following example, the most basic `useState` and `useEffect` are used to make a function provides a current `Date` with the specified interval. If the specified interval is changed, `Timer.invalidate()` will be called and then a new timer will be activated.  
Like this, the stateful logic can be extracted out as a function using Hooks.  

```swift
func useTimer(interval: TimeInterval) -> Date {
    let time = useState(Date())

    useEffect(.preserved(by: interval)) {
        let timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: interval, repeats: true) {
            time.wrappedValue = $0.fireDate
        }

        return {
            timer.invalidate()
        }
    }

    return time.wrappedValue
}
```

Let's refactor the `Example` view at the beginning of the README using this custom hook.  

```swift
struct Example: HookView {
    var hookBody: some View {
        let time = useTimer(interval: 1)

        Text("Now: \(time)")
    }
}
```

It's so much easier to read and less codes!  
Of course the stateful custom hook can be called by arbitrary views.

## How to Test Your Custom Hooks

So far, we have explained that hooks should be called within `HookScope` or `HookView`. Then, how can the custom hook you have created be tested?  
To making unit testing of your custom hooks easy, SwiftUI Hooks provides a simple and complete test utility library.  

`HookTester` enables unit testing independent of UI of custom hooks by simulating the behavior on the view of a given hook and managing the result values.  

Example:  

```swift
// Your custom hook.
func useCounter() -> (count: Int, increment: () -> Void) {
    let count = useState(0)

    func increment() {
        count.wrappedValue += 1
    }

    return (count: count.wrappedValue, increment: increment)
}
```

```swift
let tester = HookTester {
    useCounter()
}

XCTAssertEqual(tester.value.count, 0)

tester.value.increment()

XCTAssertEqual(tester.value.count, 1)

tester.update()  // Simulates view's update.

XCTAssertEqual(tester.value.count, 1)
```

---

## Context

React has a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass it down manually, it's called `Context`.  
Similarly, SwiftUI has `EnvironmentValues` to achieve the same, but defining a custom environment value is a bit of a pain, so SwiftUI Hooks provides Context API that a more user-friendly.  
This is a simple wrapper around the `EnvironmentValues`.  

```swift
typealias ColorSchemeContext = Context<Binding<ColorScheme>>

struct ContentView: HookView {
    var hookBody: some View {
        let colorScheme = useState(ColorScheme.light)

        ColorSchemeContext.Provider(value: colorScheme) {
            darkModeButton
                .background(Color(.systemBackground))
                .colorScheme(colorScheme.wrappedValue)
        }
    }

    var darkModeButton: some View {
        ColorSchemeContext.Consumer { colorScheme in
            Button("Use dark mode") {
                colorScheme.wrappedValue = .dark
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And of course, there is a `useContext` hook that can be used instead of `Context.Consumer` to retrieve the provided value.  

```swift
@ViewBuilder
var darkModeButton: some View {
    let colorScheme = useContext(ColorSchemeContext.self)

    Button("Use dark mode") {
        colorScheme.wrappedValue = .dark
    }
}
```
